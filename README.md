# Wine Quality Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the physicochemical properties and sensory quality scores of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, combining both red and white variants. The goal is to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning models.<br>

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes 11 input variables:
- Fixed acidity (g/dm³)
- Volatile acidity (g/dm³)
- Citric acid (g/dm³)
- Residual sugar (g/dm³)
- Chlorides (g/dm³)
- Free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm³)
- Total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm³)
- Density (g/cm³)
- pH
- Sulphates (g/dm³)
- Alcohol (% by volume)

The output variable is quality, scored between 0 and 10 based on sensory data.
